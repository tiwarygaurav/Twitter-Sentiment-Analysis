# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a data analytics project designed to analyze a dataset of tweets to determine the sentiment expressed in each tweetâ€”whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. The aim is to gain insights into public opinions, trends, and sentiments shared on Twitter using data analytics techniques.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure, features, and size of the dataset. Identify key variables such as tweet content, timestamp, and sentiment labels.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, duplicate entries, and irrelevant information. Ensure data quality by addressing anomalies or inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain initial insights into tweet patterns, sentiment distributions, and temporal trends using visualizations.
4. **Sentiment Distribution:** Visualize and analyze the distribution of sentiment labels to understand potential biases.
5. **Word Frequency Analysis:** Identify common terms and themes in tweets. Visualize frequent words in positive and negative sentiments.
6. **Temporal Analysis:** Explore how sentiment varies over time by analyzing tweet timestamps. Identify patterns and trends.
7. **Text Preprocessing:** Remove stop words, special characters, and URLs. Tokenize and lemmatize words for sentiment analysis.
8. **Sentiment Prediction Model:** Implement and evaluate a sentiment prediction model using machine learning or NLP techniques.
9. **Feature Importance:** Identify and visualize the most important features contributing to sentiment predictions.
10. **User Interface (Optional):** Develop a simple user interface for custom text sentiment analysis.
11. **Documentation:** Document data preprocessing steps, model implementation, and analysis findings.
12. **Insights and Recommendations:** Summarize key insights and provide recommendations based on sentiment trends observed.

## Data Exploration
**Tools Used:** Tableau, Jupyter Notebook (Python)

- Loaded the dataset in Tableau and explored its structure.
- Identified key variables such as `tweet content`, `timestamp`, and `sentiment labels`.

## Data Cleaning
**Tools Used:** Jupyter Notebook (Python)

- Addressed missing values, duplicate entries, and irrelevant information.
- Ensured data quality by resolving anomalies and inconsistencies.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Tools Used:** Tableau, Jupyter Notebook (Python)

- Conducted EDA to gain insights into tweet patterns and sentiment distributions.
- Utilized visualizations like histograms and word clouds.

## Sentiment Distribution
**Tools Used:** Tableau

- Visualized the distribution of sentiment labels.
- Analyzed the balance of sentiment classes to identify potential biases.

## Word Frequency Analysis
**Tools Used:** Jupyter Notebook (Python), WordCloud Library

- Analyzed word frequencies to identify common terms and themes.
- Created word clouds and bar charts to visualize frequent words in positive and negative sentiments.

## Temporal Analysis
**Tools Used:** Tableau

- Explored how sentiment varies over time by analyzing tweet timestamps.
- Identified patterns, peaks, and trends in sentiment within specific time frames.

## Text Preprocessing
**Tools Used:** Jupyter Notebook (Python), NLTK Library

- Preprocessed tweet text by removing stop words, special characters, and URLs.
- Tokenized and lemmatized words to prepare the text for sentiment analysis.

## Sentiment Prediction Model
**Tools Used:** Jupyter Notebook (Python), Scikit-learn Library

- Implemented a sentiment prediction model using machine learning techniques.
- Trained the model on a subset of the dataset and evaluated its performance using metrics like accuracy and F1 score.

## Feature Importance
**Tools Used:** Jupyter Notebook (Python), Scikit-learn Library

- Identified the most important features (words or phrases) contributing to sentiment predictions.
- Visualized feature importance using bar charts.

## User Interface 
**Tools Used:** Streamlit

- Developed a simple user interface allowing users to input custom text for sentiment analysis.
- Showcased sentiment prediction results in a user-friendly manner.

## Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation covering data preprocessing steps, model implementation, and analysis findings.
- Included code snippets, visualizations, and explanations for clarity.

## Insights and Recommendations
- Positive sentiments were more prevalent than negative ones, indicating general satisfaction or positive feedback on Twitter.
- Certain events or time periods exhibited spikes in negative sentiments, highlighting areas of public concern or discontent.
- Recommendations include focusing on improving aspects that received negative feedback and leveraging positive feedback for marketing and engagement strategies.
